# GroundWater

<h3>Premise<br></h3>
<p>As countries become more urbanized with their economies shifting
 towards more resource-intensive consumptions, global freshwater usage has
 increased. However, freshwater, itself, is a scarce resource with only about 3% of
 our planet’s water being freshwater. The main difference between freshwater and
 the rest of our world’s water is that freshwater is water containing less than
 1,000mg per liter of dissolved solids (salt)</p>
<h3>Introductory</h3>
The occurrence of groundwater is a result of porous materials in the ground that allows water to seep deep 
and infiltrate beneath the surface, filling the pores and fractures in layers of underground rock (aquifers). 

<strong><h3>Extraction process of groundwater</h3></strong>-Pump and Treat <br>
 <ol>
   <li><em>Identifying sources:</em> Relying on geological surveys, hydrological modeling, and drilling explantory wells<br> to determine accessibility and viability of aquifers.</li>
   
   <li><em>Drilling:</em> Wells are drilled into suitable aquifers with pumping equipment installed into the well as means of extraction</li>
   
   <li><em>Monitoring:</em> During the extraction process, it's necessary to monitor and regulate the process to prevent over-extraction.<br> 
     This is done to avoid depletion of the aquifer. Some ways of accomplishing this includes:
     <ul> 
       <li>Assessing this is measuring water levels in the well</li> 
       <li>Monitoring groundwater quality</li>
       <li>Implementing various regulations to ensure long-time use</li>
     </ul>
   </li>
   
   <li><em>Treatment:</em> Depending on groundwater quality, the water will be treated for possible contaminants like bacterium, soluables, etc. A few methods include: 
     <ul>
       <li>Air stripping: Moving volatile compounds from water into the air where in a tower with permeable material, groundwater flows by gravity downward while a stream of air flows upwards.<br> It’s also
 possible to bubble pressurized air through contaminated water in a tank, where the air in the tank is then treated by removing pollutants in their vapor phase.</li>
       <li> Granulated Activated Carbon (GAC): Contaminated water is pumped through the GAC-to-filter and trap contaminants in the water</li>
       <li>Air sparging: By pumping air into the subsurface to strip, or volatilize, contaminants from the groundwater</li>
     </ul>
   </li>
 </ol>

<h3>Problem/challenges</h3>
 <strong>Aquifer Depletion:</strong> Water level in aquifers can be depleted
 b/c of changes in precipitation and snowmelt patterns,
 over-extraction of water, and impervious materials on the
 surface that present precipitation from seeping deep into the
 ground. This leads to issues of land subsidence or sinkhole
 formation in areas, thus damaging urban development like
 buildings and roads.

<h3>Sustainable Iniatives</h3>
<em>Groundwater Management and Governance:</em> Establishing
frameworks for groundwater management from policies to
regulations, as well as institutions that monitor and assess
the condition of the aquifers.
<ol>
  <li><em>Monitoring and data collection:</em> Accurately
 gathering data on groundwater levels, quality, and
 recharge rates. Such data is collected and stored as
 either discrete field-water-level-measurements or as
 continuous time series data.
  </li>
  
  <li><em>Groundwater Recharge Projects:</em> Initiatives on
 enhancing natural groundwater recharge via
 rainwater harvesting, recharge wells, and managed
 aquifer recharge (MAR) systems as means of
 replenishing aquifers for water sustainability
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What is groundwater recharge?</strong> It’s the
 process of precipitation that infiltrates into
 the soil and moves downwards, rather than
 evaporating, to a depth where water is stored
 underground.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Managed Aquifer Recharge:</strong> accomplishes
 groundwater recharge via recharge wells that
 inject surface water/ treated surface water
 directly into aquifers. Also, infiltrations are
 bases where surface water is directed to
 excavated areas to infiltrate into the ground.
 Lastly, percolation ponds are another way
 for groundwater recharge, designing ponds
 to capture and infiltrate stormwater/surface
 water that flow downwards into soil
 substrate.
